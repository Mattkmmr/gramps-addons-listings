# Description
Filter and display available addons for the open-source genealogy program [Gramps](https://gramps-project.org/blog/). You can download them for
manual installation in the [Gramps User Directory](https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php/Gramps_5.1_Wiki_Manual_-_User_Directory) if you wish. All available addon languages are listed but only some addons have translated descriptions. The goal of this project was just to practise the use of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) and JavaScript.
